## Installation

To install the SynapseSDK API, run the following command:

```bash
pip install synapsesdk
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sorydima/SynapseSDK_API.git
cd SynapseSDK_API
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

After installation, you can quickly start using SynapseSDK in your project. Here's a basic example of connecting to a blockchain node:

```python
from synapsesdk import Node

# Initialize connection
node = Node("https://example-node-url.com")

# Fetch node status
status = node.get_status()
print(f"Node Status: {status}")
```

### Key Concepts

1. **Node Connection**: Establish secure connections to decentralized nodes.
2. **Transaction Handling**: Interact with blockchain transactions easily.
3. **Data Encryption**: Safeguard all transactions and communication with encryption.

## API Documentation

Full API documentation can be found at the following [link](https://synapsesdk-docs.example.com).

### Node Class

- `get_status()`: Returns the status of the node.
- `get_blockchain_info()`: Fetches detailed blockchain information from the node.
- `submit_transaction(data)`: Submits a transaction to the network.

### Transaction Class

- `create_transaction(data)`: Creates a new blockchain transaction.
- `sign_transaction(private_key)`: Signs the transaction with the provided private key.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to demonstrate how SynapseSDK can be used in various scenarios.

### Example 1: Submitting a Transaction

```python
from synapsesdk import Node, Transaction

# Connect to the node
node = Node("https://example-node-url.com")

# Create a new transaction
transaction = Transaction(data={"sender": "0x123", "receiver": "0x456", "amount": 100})

# Sign and submit the transaction
transaction.sign_transaction(private_key="my_private_key")
node.submit_transaction(transaction)
```

### Example 2: Fetching Blockchain Information

```python
from synapsesdk import Node

node = Node("https://example-node-url.com")

# Fetch blockchain info
blockchain_info = node.get_blockchain_info()
print(f"Blockchain Info: {blockchain_info}")
```

Th# Fully Decentralized and Distributed Blockchain Network for Everyone

## Introduction
Welcome to the future of blockchain technology! A fully decentralized and distributed network designed for universal access. This platform brings blockchain to everyone, making it easier than ever to participate in a secure, private, and scalable decentralized ecosystem.

## Key Features
### Decentralization and Distribution
Unlike traditional blockchain systems, this network is not only decentralized but fully distributed. Each participant can run their own node, ensuring there is no single point of failure and making the network extremely resilient.

### Universal Accessibility
Designed with accessibility in mind, the network is simple to use, even for those who are not crypto experts. The low barriers to entry allow anyone, from individuals to enterprises, to engage with blockchain technology.

### Enterprise-Grade Solutions
The network provides enterprise-grade solutions for sectors like finance, healthcare, and supply chain. Privacy, scalability, and data security are built into the core, making it ideal for organizations needing secure blockchain infrastructure.

### Community-Driven Ecosystem
Governance is community-driven, with users participating in decision-making processes. Through decentralized identity (DID) protocols and voting mechanisms, the network is shaped by its users.

## How It Works
Each user has the opportunity to run their own node, contributing to the health of the network. The distributed nature ensures that no one entity has control over the system, providing true decentralization. The network utilizes state-of-the-art encryption to keep all data secure and private.

## Conclusion
This fully distributed blockchain network is the key to unlocking the full potential of decentralization. Whether you're an individual or an enterprise, this platform offers an accessible and secure way to participate in the blockchain revolution.
